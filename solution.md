## Running the application

As noted in the `README` this project was created using `create-react-app`. Other available scripts are listed there, and can be viewed in the `package.json`.

To run the app in development mode run:

### `yarn start`

## Port

By default the development server will listen on `3000`.

You can specify a port by creating a `.env` file in the root of your directory, and addding:
